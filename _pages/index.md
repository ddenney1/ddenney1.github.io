## Welcome to my website!

I am an evolutionary ecologist who is broadly interested in understanding how plants have been shaped by their environments. I utilize a combination of experimental approaches, genomic sequencing data, and modeling to disentangle the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of plant populations. To address my questions, I have used *Mimulus guttatus, Boechera stricta,* and *Chamaecrista fasciculata,* as shown above.
  
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the [Plant Resilience Institute](https://plantresilience.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University where I am supervised by [Emily Josephs](https://josephslab.github.io) and [David Lowry](https://davidbryantlowry.wordpress.com/). I completed my PhD in Plant Biology at the University of Georgia with [Jill Anderson](https://anderson.franklinresearch.uga.edu/).
